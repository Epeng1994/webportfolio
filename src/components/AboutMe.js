                <p>Welcome! I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from the Bloomtech Web Development Bootcamp with a bachelor’s degree in 
                    Computer Information Systems (CIS). Prior to becoming a full stack developer, I worked within the healthcare industry for 4 years where I gained invaluable experience working with not only groups and departments
                     but also working independently. I decided to transition back to software in order to utilize my creativity and problem-solving mindset that I could not with healthcare.
                    Now I explore various coding projects and continously challenge myself by learning algorithms and data structures. Contact me below if you'd like to know more!</p>

export default AboutMe

/*
Graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering, 
and having worked in the healthcare sector for three years, 
I am always avid in being hands on, learning new technologies and collaborating with others. 
I chose to abandon the path of tinkering with hardware to 
transition to software to fully expand on my creativity that I couldn't with hardware. 
Bringing my problem solving background and a team oriented mindset with me, 
I have shifted my career path to not just be a software developer/engineer but to be an effective 
critical thinker simultaneously. Outside of all this, I like to crack lame jokes, make memes, and 
having a good time with people :)
