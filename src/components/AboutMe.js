                <p>Welcome! I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from the Bloomtech Web Development Bootcamp with a bachelorâ€™s degree in 
                    Computer Information Systems (CIS). Prior to becoming a full stack developer, I worked within the healthcare industry for 4 years where I gained invaluable experience working with not only groups and departments
                     but also working independently. I decided to transition back to software in order to utilize my creativity and problem-solving mindset that I could not with healthcare.
                    Now I explore various coding projects and continously challenge myself by learning algorithms and data structures. Contact me below if you'd like to know more!</p>
